<!--
    This popup is a UI for the Chrome extension 'Xap the Senior, Filter'.

    The extension filters out job postings from seek.com.au that contain certain keywords
    in their titles. The extension is configured by the user in the form of a black
    list of keywords. The popup displays the current configuration and allows the user
    to add new keywords to the list.

    The popup also displays the total number of jobs, the number of jobs filtered out,
    and the number of jobs visible after filtering.

    The extension is implemented with the content.js script that filters out job postings
    from the job search results page. The content script is injected into the page
    after the page has finished loading, and it monitors the page for changes to
    the list of job postings using a MutationObserver.

    When the content script is notified of a change to the list of job postings, it
    re-applies the filter. The content script also listens for messages from the popup
    and updates the filter accordingly.

    The popup communicates with the content script using the chrome.tabs API. The
    popup sends a message to the content script to apply the filter, and the content
    script sends a message back to the popup with the total number of jobs, the
    number of jobs filtered out, and the number of jobs visible after filtering.
