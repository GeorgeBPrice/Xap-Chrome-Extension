# Chrome Extension, Zap the Senior jobs, filter

## Overview

The Xap Chrome extension filters out Senior rolled job listings based on predefined keywords, allowing users to hide job posts with specific titles. This is a cheeky work-around to remove the Senior job spam, for job searchers who are no there yet!. Alternatively, you may add your own keyword filters entirely. The filtering is case-insensitive, so job titles are matched regardless of capitalization. Filters persist in local browser storage.

## Features

- **Keyword-based filtering**: Hide job listings that contain certain words in the title.
- **Case-insensitive matching**: Searches are performed in lowercase to ensure consistent filtering.
- **User-defined keywords**: Add or remove keywords dynamically via the extension popup.
